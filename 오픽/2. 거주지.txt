It's just enough for me to take a rest.

Because of his appearance, people used to get him wrong.

I was taking a walk at the park as usual. A few minutes later, someone approached me. So I tried to figure out who he was. And then the moment that I realized he was my old friend '재훈', I was like "Wow! long time no see!!".  And we talked for a long time. And we exchanged out phone number. We still contact each other. So I was able to make my old friend again.

There are many problems. But what I 'm really important to think is people just throw their garbage away anywhere. It's really important because It cause many environmetal problems. I think It's really bad. And also It makes park looks dirty. So people who visit the park have to care about their garbage more carefully. they have to pick up their garbage. if every people do it, we can keep the park clean.

it's very funny, when i go to the gym, sometimes i spend more time to listen to music than exercise.

a couple of year ago, i traveled with my friends to jeju island. Actually, it was really fantastic at first. But the end of the travel, we faced a serious problem. we missed airplane. It was just so terrible. But we thought positively. so we just bought a ticket again. we thought that it was just experience and it can happen. and we were able to come back home without any trouble. 
Thorough this experience, I'm keeping in my mind that when i face problems, just think positively. It helps to solve problems.

when i have a vacation, i love staying at home. It jsut so comfortable. what i really love to do at home is watching tv.

A couple of years ago, i traveled vietnam with my friends. it was so fantastic. there were many interesting things. one thing i really think it's interesting is it was so hot. many people, you know, almost every local people only wore short sleeves. they didn't wear long sleeves. when i was getting there, immediately i really related to it. i sweated a lot, so i wasn't able to wear a long sleeve. so i changed my clothes. If you go there, i fully recommend you not to wear long sleeves.

I think May 5th was not holiday when i was young. But I think previous government decided to make that day a public holiday. I think it's really good decision. Because people who don't have enough time to be with their kids can be with them on that day. And many kids can make memorable experience with their parents. Although i became adult, It makes me feel really happy to be with my parents on every May 5th. And It's also an opportunity to behave like kids in front of my parents.

[Question 2]
How are household tasks divided in your home now? What chores do you normally do? What tasks do your family members usually complete? How do you feel about this distribution? Is it fair?

[Answer 2]
There are a few houshold tasks that i have to do. Like washing dishes after i finish eating. And you know, There is a one rule that i have to really do at home. Clean your room by yourself. I think it's really fair. Because you know, it's really hard to clean entire house alone. But instead, clean my room by myself is quite easier. Because it just so small. i just clean a small space. 
So i'm really satisfied with this rule. and when i have a my own house, I will make this rule at my home.
